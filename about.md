# Pivot Snap

simple editor qol mod to enhance the quality of lives by allowing ppl to snap the pivot point to the sides and edges when warping objects

this is my first ever mod so i hope u enjoyed, dont forget to like, subscribe and hit that bell

# How to use

### **before use, change the snap mode in the mod's settings. <cr>If you're NOT on windows, the "keybind" option is not supported, so please change it to "button"**</c>

On desktop, the default keybind to change the snap mode is X, you can change that in the custom keybinds settings.

On mac/android, use the snap button on the left.

If you encounter any issues, privately message me on discord (@steechy) or ping me in the [geode sdk server](discord.gg/geode) (or find any other way to contact me) and i'll try to fix it

###### thx hiimjustin000 for helping with adding mac & android support!!
