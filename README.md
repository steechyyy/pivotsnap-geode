<img src="logo.png" width="150" alt="the mod's logo" />

simple editor qol mod to enhance the quality of lives by allowing ppl to snap the pivot point to the sides and edges when warping objects

this is my first ever mod so i hope u enjoyed, dont forget to subscribe and hit that bell

## How to use
On desktop, the default keybind to change the snap mode is X, you can change that in the custom keybinds settings.

If you encounter any issues ping me in the [geode sdk discord](discord.gg/geode) and i'll try to fix it
