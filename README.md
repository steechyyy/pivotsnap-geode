# How to use

### **before use, change the snap mode in the mod's settings. <cr>IF YOU'RE ON MOBILE, THE "keybind" OPTION ISN'T SUPPORTED, so please change it to "button"**</c>

**The default keybind to snap is X**. When using the button, **the button is found on the left side of the screen.**
*(im working on more methods i promise)*
